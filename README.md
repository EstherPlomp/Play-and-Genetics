# Play-and-Genetics
Using an original approach, behavioural genetics and developmental psychology methodologies are uniquely combined to better understand the function of play, its origin, and its purpose in child development. Variables related to children, their parents, and the genetic propensities of both will be combined to explore linkages between home environments, play, and childrenâ€™s social/cognitive outcomes, in a cross-cohort-longitudinalapproach. Data from three UK longitudinal studies will be used in a holistic attempt to tap into the construct of play given it is a multidimensional construct. The study addresses the call for novel approaches to studying how play relates to child development.
