# Play and Child Development: Role of Parent and Child Genes and the Environment
Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality (Lewis Caroll – Alice in Wonderland)





## Welcome
My name is Dr. Gill Althia Francis and I am one of the recipients of the Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship 2021-2024 cohort. My research experience is in the area of play and cognitive development. My current research interest is in finding evidence that unpacks the causal role of play in child development.

Thank you for visiting my project repository! This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 





## Vision Statement
To understand the genetic and environmental influences of children's play. 





## What is the project about?

### The Problem
There is a lack lack of knowledge about whether links between play, child outcomes, and parental influences are genetically influenced?


Using a cross-cohort-longitudinal approach, data from three UK longitudinal studies (TEDS, ALSPAC, Millenium Cohort Study) will be used to:
1) unpack and compare the mullti-dimensionality of the construct play in cohort studies
2) to identify correlations between play and child development outcomes
3) Determine whether there is overlap in the genetic architecture underpinning children’s play considering established links between play and social/cognitive outcomes i.e., general cognitive ability, language, learning, pro-social behaviour etc. (Work Package 1, WP1).
2. Using the results from WP1, test whether the selected social and cognitive outcomes associated with children’s play behaviours are linked to genetic indices e.g. (Work Package 2, WP2).
3. Model the effect of gene-environment interplay on children’s play behaviours using children’s and parent’s genetic data (WP2)
4. Map the longitudinal pathways from gene-environment interplay on children’s social and cognitive development through play (WP2).
5. To develop a methodological framework and explanatory guideline for interpreting behavioural genetics research in this field (Work Package 3, WP3).
