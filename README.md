# Play and Child Development: Role of Parent and Child Genes and the Environment
Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality (Lewis Caroll – Alice in Wonderland)





## Welcome
My name is Dr. Gill Althia Francis and I am one of the recipients of the Leverhulme Early Career Fellowship 2021-2024 cohort. My research experience is in the area of play and cognitive development. My current research interest is in finding evidence that unpacks the causal role of play in child development.

Thank you for visiting my project repository! This document (the README file) is a hub to give you some information about the project. 





## Vision Statement
To understand the genetic and environmental influences of children's play. 





## What is the project about?

### The Problem
There is a lack lack of knowledge about whether links between play, child outcomes, and parental influences are genetically influenced?






### Solution 
Share findings that play and genetics researchers can engagement

### Addition Project Details
