. Determine whether there is overlap in the genetic architecture underpinning children’s play
considering established links between play and social/cognitive outcomes i.e., general
cognitive ability, language, learning, pro-social behaviour etc. (Work Package 1, WP1).
2. Using the results from WP1, test whether the selected social and cognitive outcomes
associated with children’s play behaviours are linked to genetic indices e.g. (Work Package
2, WP2).
3. Model the effect of gene-environment interplay on children’s play behaviours using children’s
and parent’s genetic data (WP2)
4. Map the longitudinal pathways from gene-environment interplay on children’s social and
cognitive development through play (WP2).
5. To develop a methodological framework and explanatory guideline for interpreting
behavioural genetics research in this field (Work Package 3, WP3).
